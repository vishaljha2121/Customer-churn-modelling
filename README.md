Customer Churn is a metric used to quantify the number of customers who left the company.

Customer Churn is a metric used to quantify the number of customers who left the company. For SaaS businesses, it can be defined by those who unsubscribed or canceled the service contracted earlier. But for e-commerce companies selling a product which doesn’t require a subscription, it can be quite tricky to tell when a customer churned.
Identifying early who is at risk to leave is the best way to segment your campaigns to re-engage these users effectively and in time because it is more expensive and time-consuming acquiring new customers than retaining old ones. This statement is significantly true for e-commerce companies. Getting new customers always demand a lot of marketing efforts, the company has to show trustworthy to potential consumers before they think of clicking the “buy it” button. It generally takes time. Old customers are familiar with the store, they have all the convenience of coming back there without the need of registering on the website since they have already gone through it on their first purchase.
